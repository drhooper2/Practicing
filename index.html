        <p>My biggest issue seems to be <em>getting a url from github.</em> I suppose that will come in time.</p>
        <p>Ta da! I have a url. It has only taken me almost a week to get it, but I have it.</p>

        <p>I haven't tried creating a new url for a while, but have been having some success with other elements in both html and css. I'm pretty proud of myself for being able to do some things now, without having to look them up.</p>

                <li>I have been trying really hard.</li>
                <li>I am determined to learn how to do this.</li>
         </ol>

        <p>I have been having some luck getting images to work for me, so that's something that's going right. I just discovered here that <strong>if I want my text to be under a photo, I have to be sure to start a new paragraph under the photo,</strong> otherwise it will start beside the photo at the bottom.</p>
    <!--if I want something to be sectioned off, I need to put it in a section, duh, makes sense-->

        alt="Looking Up" />
        Trying to see if this text goes beside the image. (This is an example of what happens if I don't start a new paragraph under the image; it places the text beside the image, and not below it).

        <p>This cat makes me think of me sometimes in that I feel I just stare off into space.<br>
        (This is a paragraph that was started under the image).</p>
